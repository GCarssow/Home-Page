    <h4><strong>Fitness has always been a big part of my life.  I'm a former Army Captain, and I didn't stop enjoying working out when I left the Service.</strong></h4>

    <p>Definitely not me.</p>
    <h4>For one of my projects, I decided to make a Workout and Exercise database, which could give you both a random workout for the day, but also 
      provides you with an archive of exercises in case you are unfamiliar with one.  You can even add new workouts and exercises as you go!
      The link is located above in my dropdown menu under "a few projects", or just click here.

    <h4>So what was involved in making this Workout Application?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>I built the entire thing in React.  Front-End Frameworks are really the wave of the future.  To be blunt I didn't 
          appreciate their utility until I started working on this site, and realized the benefits of component-based architecture.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>A lot of the stuff on it I had to teach myself how to do.  I wanted to ensure that it had a functioning ability to pull a random workout from the database 
          (it's amazing how many incorrect ways are published on the Web about how to pull a random object from a database)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Likewise, I had to teach myself how to integrate the API I had created with React as well.  To be honest, once I got the hang of it, 
          I was sort of surprised that it wasn't as difficult as I expected it to be.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>My next hope is to eventually refactor my entire personal site with React.</li>
