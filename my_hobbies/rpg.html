    <img src="l5r.png" alt="One of my favorite RPGs">
    <p>I've always been pretty nerdy, but in the last few years I've really sunk my teeth into Tabletop RPGs (though I'm by no means new to them).  My favorite RPG of all I have played is Legend of the Five Rings (usually abbreviated as L5R), an RPG set in a fantasy version of Feudal Japan. <br>
    In fact, one of my first projects that I did for Galvanize was help reprogram and update a Legend of the Five Rings character maker that someone created some time ago. </p>

    <p>Since then, I have continued to improve some more RPG stuff, including working on custom character classes (often called "Homebrew") for Dungeons and Dragons, 5th Edition, and continuing to improve my L5R project</p>
