    <h3><strong>I got into Scuba Diving back when I lived in California, and I've been in love with it ever since.  Unfortunately 
      living in Colorado can make it very difficult to do some good diving, but I've tried to travel when I could to do some more.

    <h3><strong>This me during a "shark feed" dive at the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.
      Yeah it was cheating to bring down food to get the sharks there, but it was worth it.

      <h3><strong>Interestingly, despite being thousands of miles from any oceans, Denver has an extremely high percentage of people
        qualified as SCUBA divers.  If you're interested in getting certified, I used PADI, and they've always been great.
