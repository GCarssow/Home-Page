<h1><strong>My Wife and Daughter</strong></h1>
<img src="wedding.jpg" alt="Us at a Wedding in California">
<h4>My Wife, Courtney, was born and raised in both Annapolis and Baltimore, MD.  She is a graduate of Columbia University (both undergraduate and graduate) in NYC, as well as Johns Hopkins school of Nursing. <br>
She currently works as a Clinical Editor for an Operating Room Journal. <br>
As you can probably guess, she is the brains of the operation.</h4>

<h4>This is us at a wedding near San Jose, CA.</h4>
<img src="Colette.jpg" alt="My daughter">
<h4>My daughter Colette was born May 22, 2018, during my time in Galvanize.  People have asked me how I managed to go through Galvanize
  and have a kid, and I'll tell you what I told them: I have no idea.
