      <H2><A name="section1">My Hometown</A>
        <p>I was born and raised in Atlanta, GA.  Although I moved around a few times, I lived in the city of Atlanta from birth till I went to College.
          Although I thought of moving back from time to time, traffic and housing prices have gotten worse than ever in Atlanta, and I really like Denver.
        And yes, I am an Atlanta sports fan, because apparently I am a masochist.</p>

        <H2><A name="section2">College</A>
          <p>I attended the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington, VA for college.  I didn't have to go to a Military school, 
    but I wanted to go to a place that challenged me and was atypical of "regular" colleges.  While it was definitely difficult to listen
    to my friends tell story about the fun they were having in College, I definitely feel like being there increased my discipline, fitness, and 
    as VMI Alums like to say "it's a great place to be from, but not a great place to be at".
</p>
   <img src="../pictures_for_site/VMI.jpg" alt="Virginia Military Institute">
<H2><A name="section3">The Army</A>
  <p>At the end of my time at VMI, I commissioned as a Second Lieutenant, Field Artillery, United States Army.
    I'm not going to go into my entire Military career, because it would go on for quite a while.  Needless to say, I wound up living all over the place,
    including Oklahoma, Washington, Georgia, Germany, Iraq, California, and Texas.  I had a lot of different jobs, including Fire Direction Officer, Fire Support Officer, Infantry Platoon Leader, and I was a Company
    Commander twice.</p>
    <p>After 8.5 years in the Army, I decided to move on.  I had moved seven times in the last 8.5 years, and coming to the end of my second command,
 I knew that I more than likely had several years of working Staff to look forward to.

  <H2><A name="section4">Moving to Denver</A>   
    <p>After I got done with the Army, my original intent was to either stay in Texas or move back to the Southeast.  However, I utilized a Veteran recruiting firm, and during the hunt they had me interview with an HVAC-R and construction firm in Denver.
      I had spent time in Denver before, and really enjoyed the city, so when they made me an offer, it seemed an immediate fit.
    </p>

    <H2><A name="section5">Changing Careers</A>   
      <p>I spent about 2 years as a Manager at the HVAC-R and construction company.  Although I enjoyed the company and was good at what I did, I increasingly began to hate
        the idea of working in Management for the rest of my days.  I really began to desire the idea of having some sort of palpable skills to my name, besides vague concepts like "organization" and "leadership".
      
        <strong>But what to do?</strong>
      I spent some time thinking about it, and I narrowed it down to two things I was really interested in: Medicine and Technology.  At the time, I was single with no family, so I knew I could devote years to whatever endeavour I chose to pursue, so I opted to choose medicine.  
        Little did I know my life would soon change in very unexpected ways.</p>
        <H2><A name="section6">Family Life and another Pivot</A>  
        <p>Only a few short months after I went back to school, I met my now wife, Courtney.  As both of us were older, our relationship moved quickly, and it wasn't particularly long until we were married
          and were wanting to start a family.  With a kid on the way and us wanting to stay in Denver, suddenly the idea of me spending years in medical school and residency was looking less and less realistic.
        </p>
        <strong><a href="../personal_life/courtney.html">Info on Courtney and my family</a></strong>
        <p>So it was that I decided to move into Tech.  To be 100% honest, the decision was easier than I had expected.  The more time I spent in Healthcare the more 
          disillusioned I was becoming with our Healthcare system.  Likewise, with my daughter now born, having a job that provided greater work/life flexibility seemed more important than ever.  
          So it was that I took the plunge and went to Galvanize for their Web Development Immersive Program.
